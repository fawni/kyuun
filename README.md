A simple Spotify playlists analyzer

## Motivation

Sometimes i want a quick summary about a playlist to ~~judge~~ get a general idea of what it offers. For me it's particularily interesting for the unique playlists that Spotify taylors to each user!

It simply lists the artists and how many times they appear in the playlist along with some other basic stats but i might add more stuff in the future!
